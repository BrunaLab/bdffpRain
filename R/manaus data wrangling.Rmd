*Last compiled: `r Sys.Date()`*

# Purpose

read in and wrangle manaus data to a data frame

# Load Data

```{r data, echo=TRUE}
raw_text <- read_lines(here("data_raw", "MAO_climdata_1985-2019.rtf"))

raw <- read_delim(raw_text[26:length(raw_text)], delim = ";")
unique(raw$Hora)
```

## Data Dictionary

`Dataframe1`: My data

- `col1`: A variable
- `col2`: Another variable

# Wrangling steps

0. get rid of `\` column and last couple of rows that didn't read correctly
1. split data by "Hora" (which doesn't seem to actually represent time)
2. recombine so there are half as many rows
3. translate column headings
3. convert date to date
